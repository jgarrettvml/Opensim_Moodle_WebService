# Opensimulator/SecondLife Moodle WebService
This is a connector between OpenSimulator/SecondLife and Moodle Web Service


It was going to be a part of a larger project to be open-sourced, but have decided not to continue the project so am putting it online "as-is" so that it can remain in the public domain, any distribution of this source code or derivatives must be distributed under the same GNU 2.0 license. https://github.com/jgarrettvml/Opensim_Moodle_WebService/blob/main/LICENSE

The concepts for creating this tool was based on a previous open-source project, Sloodle, which use to accomplish similar functionality but development ceased in 2014 https://github.com/sloodle/moodle-mod_sloodle

Step 1: Download and install Moodle LMS

Step 2: Configure Moodle Web Services for API access, this is crucial and will not work without it

Step 3: Place LSL script inside object and update credentials
